This project provides a utility for identifying cryptographic algorithms based on given inputs, such as algorithm names, key sizes, or other characteristics. The identifier aims to assist in selecting and validating cryptographic algorithms for secure communication and data protection.

**Features**
- **Algorithm Detection**: Identify cryptographic algorithms by their names, key sizes, or properties.
- **Supported Algorithms**: Support for common algorithms such as AES, DES, Blowfish etc.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new algorithms and properties to the identifier.
- **Validation**: Check if the specified algorithm meets certain security criteria (e.g., key size, hashing strength).

**Prerequisites**

Before using this tool, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries specified in requirements.txt
